* What is this?

This is a arduino project to control a simple fog machine like the crenova FM-02. The Original switch does nothing more than short circuit two of the three wires. I made a simple circuit which is connected to the original switch. Another possibility would be to replace the original switch.

* How to use?
Just change the define statements to match your requirements. Then load it to your arduino and connect it to your circuit.

* What circuit do I need?
I myself used a relais to switch the fog machine. Normally a transistor should also work.

* Further work
In the future I want to read the led state of my original switch to know when the fog machine is in ready state. For now, this works fine enough for my needs.
